## 🧑‍💻 Student Exploration Challenges

Ready to level up your code? Choose a challenge below and try to add it to your calculator!

* **The Modulus Button:** Add a button that uses the `%` operator to find the remainder of division. 
* **The Power Button:** Add a button that uses the `**` operator (or `Math.pow()`) to calculate exponents. 
* **More Inputs:** Expand the calculator! Add a third (or fourth) input box and create a new button that adds, multiplies, or averages all of the numbers together.
* **The Clear Button:** Write a new function that empties the text out of the input boxes and resets the answer display to its original state.
* **UI Designer:** Open your CSS file (or add a `<style>` tag) to change the background colors of your buttons so that addition is green, subtraction is red, etc.
